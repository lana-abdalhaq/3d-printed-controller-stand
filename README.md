3D printed gaming controller stand designed in Fusion 360

  Xbox Controllers • PS5 Controllers • PC controllers


 **Project Overview**

This project is a 3D-printed controller stand designed to hold gaming controllers such as the Xbox controllers,  standard PS5 controllers and PC controllers.

I designed and modeled the stand using Autodesk Fusion 360 with a parametric workflow, then prepared it for printing using UltiMaker Cura 5.11.0.

The main goal was to create a simple, stable, and clean-looking stand that keeps controllers organized and ready to use.


- **Why I Made This**

I wanted a practical way to:

Keep my desk organized

Store controllers safely when not in use

Prevent scratches or accidental drops

Add a minimal touch to the gaming setup


- **Design Features**

Universal shape that fits multiple controller types

Wide base for better stability

Slight angled support for natural positioning

Smooth edges for a cleaner finish

Parametric dimensions that can be adjusted if needed


- **Design Approach**

While modeling the stand, I focused on:

Making sure the weight is balanced

Creating enough contact area to prevent slipping

Rounding edges to avoid sharp corners

Optimizing the shape for easier 3D printing

Reducing the need for supports during printing

- 🛠 Software Used

Autodesk Fusion 360 – 3D modeling and rendering

UltiMaker Cura 5.11.0 – Slicing and G-code generation


- **Modeling Process**

Sketched the base with defined dimensions

Designed the angled support structure

Extruded the main body

Applied fillets to smooth the edges

Checked controller clearances

Exported the STL file for printing

🖨 3D Printing

The final model was exported as an STL file and imported into Cura.

In Cura, I:

Adjusted layer height

Set infill percentage

Configured supports (if needed)

Generated and previewed the G-code

The design was made to print efficiently with minimal supports.


- **Files Included**

Fusion 360 (.f3d) file

STL file for printing

Render images


- **Possible Improvements**

Adding a cable management slot

Creating a dual-controller version

Customizing the front surface

Adding a soft TPU grip insert
Exploring flexible TPU grip insert
